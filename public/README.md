## Overview
After learning SASS for styling, I took on this challenge to create a responsive website layout. Leveraging SASS's nesting, variables, mixins, extends, and functions, I wrote clean, modular, and efficient code. It enabled me to easily organize styles, reuse code, and adapt designs to different breakpoints. The result is a visually appealing and responsive website.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
